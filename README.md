### Social Distancing Project
Idea Credits: Landing AI


### Description
The objective of the project is to have a visual representation of which people are fulfilling the social distancing as a measure to prevent COVID-19. The information for the bounding boxes is in the file "TownCentre-groundtruth_top.csv". To measure the distance between people it is necessary to make a bird eye view. People that are not fulfilling the minimum social distance of 2 meters have a red bounding box. In addition, a red line is drawn between irresponsible people. Finally, an index of irresponsible people is shown in the presentation video.
